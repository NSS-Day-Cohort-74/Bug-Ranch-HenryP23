# Welcome to Bug Wrangler Ranch

This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Description

Slim Jenkins offers a vacation package for people who have always wanted to join a cattle driving team across the American Midwest.

He calls it the **Kansas Slim's Cattle Adventure**.

People join a team of experienced drovers who will train them in the basics of herding cattle and driving them across hundreds of miles to their destination at Old Red's Ranch.

Unfortunately, someone gained access to the code that produces an outline of the adventure to the paying customers, so Slim has hired you to examine and fix the code.

## Learning Objectives

Here are your learning objectives for this self-assessment.

1. Able to use the debugger to step through existing code to discover root causes of bugs.
2. Drawing a sequence diagram for a project.
   > Use the [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) site to generate your sequence diagram. Make sure you save your work as you go.
3. Demonstrate learning efficiency by researching concepts you haven't seen before using your peers, mentors, and the World Wide Web as resources.
4. Awareness of when you need help, and then seeking it out.

## Example Output

If you are able to fix all of the bugs, you will output similar to what is below. It will not be identical, but similar.

```sh

You will be accompanying 5 drovers as they drive 50 cattle to Old Red's Ranch for grazing

The herd is made of up the following types of cattle:
Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,American Angus,Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,
Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,

Here is the team of drovers you will be joining
        * Melvyn Hethron
        * Yancy Gresley
        * Willabella Attarge
        * Ynes Gyenes
        * Farlie Spere


Your journey will take you through the wildness of the American Midwest and across the following terrain
        * forest
        * plain
        * river
        * mountain
```

1. In the **main** module, one of the first lines of code is `const drovers = hireDrovers(cattleToDrive)`. Explain what the value of the `drovers` variable is when that line of code runs.
   > the variable drovers contains the return of the function hireDrovers(cattleToDriver). If the return is not specified, it will return undefined.
   > currently when it runs it will get undefined, because the function has no return. Once we give it a return, drovers will equal several objects within an array. > The objects contain random drovers pulled from the database array.
2. At the bottom of the main module, you will see the following code - `for (const drover of drovers)`. Explain what the values of both the `drover` and the `drovers` variables are.
   > drovers is an array of objects. drover represents each element of drovers as it iterates through the for loop. during the first loop, drover will equal drovers index 0 which is the first object within the array.
3. In the **journey** module, there is a `journeyMaker()` function. In that function, there is a variable named `areas` which will have the value of an object. Use your debugger to show what the value of each key is on that object. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record your session.
   > https://www.loom.com/share/0399ee38316040cd92ffe9cf828cbda3?sid=d23146ca-bc63-41b3-900d-15e7f49b06d7
4. Also in the **journey** module, there is the following code:
   ```js
   for (let forestNumber = 0; forestNumber < areas.forests; forestNumber++) {
     journey.push("forest");
   }
   ```
   Explain this code with your best vocabulary.
   > Lets start where a for loop starts, in the header. We are first declaring and initializing forestNumber to equal 0. Then we create a condition that says if forestNumber is less than areas.forests then we will keep looping. areas.forest is accessing an object through its properties. areas is an object and forest is a key/name in areas object. The key forest allows us to access a value. In this case our value is the function createForests() Which is creating a random number and returning it. The condition in a for loop is a big part of what allows our for loop to start or stop if the condition is met. Lastly we have i++ which increments forest number by 1 every time we loop. What this does is update our loop so we can check our condition again and again until our loop ends.In the body we are pushing the string forest to a array called journey however many times our area.forests is (which is random).
5. Explain the value of the `database` variable in the **database** module. Be as comprehensive as possible.
   > database is an array. Its an array that contains nested arrays, each nested array has a property name. within each nested array there are several objects.
6. In the **drovers** module, there is a `hireDrovers()` function. You will notice the following code on that line - `(herdSize)`. What is that defining, and where does it get its value?
   > herdSize is a parameter which is a placeholder for a value. We are invoking the hireDrovers() function in main.js when we are printing out the team of drovers. When we invoke hireDrovers we are passing in an argument of cattleToDrive which equals 50. In the function our parameter is now going to equal 50.

## When You Are Done

After you have answered all the questions above, you need to push all of your code back up to Github. Follow these instructions.

1. Be in the `bug-wrangler-ranch` directory.
2. `git add --all`
3. `git commit -m "Code complete"`
4. `git push origin main`

Then go to the Learning Platform and click the **Self-assessment Complete** button.
